                    Iâ€™m french developer and first year computer science
                    student. I working on web 3.0 projects with technologies
                    like React, Node JS and more. I also develop blockchain
                    projects with solidity.

                    I started frontend development because I like when websites
                    or applications are pleasant to use and intuitive. I love
                    designs that are out of the ordinary. My experience in
                    drawing could help me in this area.

                        To become a frontend developer, I started by acquiring a
                        solid foundation in HTML and CSS. Then I got into
                        javascript. To start creating and working on projects, I
                        learned React and React Native, then SASS which I liked much
                        more than CSS. Finally I started to work a lot with NextJS
                        to work on bigger projects. I also use some libraries like
                        Three.JS or Parallax.JS.

                        I started backend development in my studies even though I
                        already had some basics in python. I learned Java, SQL and
                        C# with which I did some projects. To work on fullstack
                        projects, I learned to use NodeJS, Express and MongoDB in
                        particular to create REST APIs and to make online chat
                        systems.
